# Luna
 GPT-4 Powered Assistant

A front-end app for GPT-4 that acts as a terminal window chat. Provides prompts for sentiment simulation and front-end scripts that handle response-to-command conversions, allowing the LLM to take partial control of the machine.

Several helper scripts were developed to increase control over the machine and with the help of some custom networking in the form of server:client connections, it's able to communicate with a main machine and make calls to local ML models, allowing for remote usage of high computation models for image generation and video generation.
